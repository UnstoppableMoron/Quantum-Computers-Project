            <h3>Error Correction</h3>
            <p>Most experts would consider this the biggest challenge. Quantum computers are extremely sensitive to noise and errors caused by interactions with their environment. This can cause errors to accumulate and degrade the quality of computation. Developing reliable error correction techniques is therefore essential for building practical quantum computers.</p>

          <div id="col2"class="col-sm">
            <h3>Scalability</h3>
            <p>While quantum computers have shown impressive performance for some tasks, they are still relatively small compared to classical computers. Scaling up quantum computers to hundreds or thousands of qubits while maintaining high levels of coherence and low error rates remains a major challenge.</p>

              <h3>Hardware Development</h3>
              <p>Developing high-quality quantum hardware, such as qubits and control electronics, is a major challenge. There are many different qubit technologies, each with its own strengths and weaknesses, and developing a scalable, fault-tolerant qubit technology is a major focus of research.</p>
            </div>
            <div id="col2"class="col-sm">
              <h3>Trained Talent</h3>
              <p>The number of people properly educated and trained to enter the quantum workforce is small and spread across the world. Finding the right workers is a challenge. We likely won’t increase the number of people motivated to enter the quantum workforce until we have more  quantum computers, and we won’t have more quantum computers until we have more people motivated to become part of the quantum workforce.</p>
